Remove errCheck in favor of custom routines for each error situation (only 33, should take an hour or two)
FIGURE OUT WHERE THE DAMN ERROR IS COMING FROM
Move some of the functions into other packages (such as the cache and blacklist)
    - cache and blacklist would be one package
    - redis would be one
    - json would be one
    - buzzwords can stay in main
    - discordFunc and testCommands would be one
    - misc can also stay in main
    - reddit handing can be one
Write a lot of tests
Use a seperate redis database for channel data instead of a map
Either use Redis or some other form of database to cache reddit posts instead of caching them to RAM, its not good practice
