Welcome to the Official Discord-Quick-Meme User Guide!

This short tutorial will instruct you about all of the wonders of Discord-Quick-Memes!

### Basic Usage

* To get a meme, simply type `!meme`.
* To get a joke, simply type `!joke`.
* To get some news, simply type `!news`.
* To get a meme, a joke, or some news from a subreddit of your choice, simply put the name of the subreddit after the command. For example: `!meme dankmemes` (without the `r/`). `!meme` will always pull media, such as images, gifs, and videos. `!joke` will always get pure text. `!news` will always get a link to the post.
* To get a link to the last posted reddit post, type `!source`.

For subscribing a channel to a subreddit and general admin use, see the [Admins](admins.md#subscriptions) page.
