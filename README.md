## Additional Random Info and Facts

- This bot caches the 100 "hottest" posts on all subreddits called upon it to decrease the response time to the minimum.
- This bot was made as a side project of mine, an idea as some of my friends were not really Reddit users but I always talked about the memes and posts. They use Reddit now.
