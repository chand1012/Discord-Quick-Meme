## To add

If you are a server owner, just click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=438381344943374346&scope=bot) and select your channel to add the bot to your channel.

## COMING SOON: Support the bot!

Soon I will be launching a Patreon, which will get you some cool extra features! Features are also available to those who support me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/chand1012)! Cool features include:

- No spam limiter!
- Image proxies!
    - Two image proxies will be available: 
        - Discord's own image uploads (as long as the image in question is >=8MB).
        - My custom [Image Proxy Service]().
    - **DISCLAIMER**: This Discord bot is for fun, and the proxy service is mainly for speed increases when Reddit is at high load. Yes, you can use it to circumvent firewalls, but I am not responsible if you get in trouble.
- More than one queue per channel!
    - For example, you could have a queue from r/dankmemes set for once every hour and a queue set for r/prequelmemes set for once every 66 minutes.
- Your name or username on my sponsor list on the bot!
- More features to be announced!
- Early access to certain alpha features! <sub> Beta features will always be public. </sub>
- My gratitude and the knowledge that you are helping a developer get closer to making his hobby a living!

## Additional Random Info and Facts

- This bot caches the 100 "hottest" posts on all subreddits called upon it to decrease the response time to the minimum.
- This bot was made as a side project of mine, an idea as some of my friends were not really Reddit users but I always talked about the memes and posts. They use Reddit now.
